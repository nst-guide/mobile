# Mobile app

This repository holds the in-progress code for the mobile app for National Scenic Trails Guide.

There are several ways I'm trying to move fast. This is a [React Native][react-native] app, so I only have to code once, in JavaScript to have mobile apps that work on both iOS and Android. I'm using the Mapbox mapping SDKs via the [react-native-mapbox-gl][react-native-mapbox-gl] project.
